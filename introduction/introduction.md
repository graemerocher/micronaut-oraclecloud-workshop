# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is for Java Developers looking to start building applications with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) and [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) with [Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/).

The workshop features several labs that walk you through the steps to get going with Micronaut and Oracle Cloud.

The source code with completed example code is [available on Github](https://github.com/graemerocher/micronaut-oraclecloud-workshop).

Several branches exist in the source code for different permutations of the application:

* The `jdbc` branch includes an example with Micronaut Data JDBC and Autonomous Database
* The `jdbc-h2` branch includes an example with Micronaut Data JDBC and H2 Database that can be run locally without the Cloud.
* The `jpa-h2` branch includes an example with Micronaut Data JPA and H2 Database that can be run locally without the Cloud.

Estimated Workshop Time: 240 minutes

### About Micronaut

Micronaut is an innovative new server-side Java technology that precomputes your framework infrastructure at compilation time. Micronaut can be combined with GraalVM Native Image to build native applications that use less memory and are smaller and faster because of ahead of time (AOT) compilation technology.

Micronaut also includes a persistence framework called Micronaut Data that precomputes your SQL queries at compilation time, making it a great fit for working with Autonomous Database.

### Objectives
This 4-hour lab walks you through the steps to use Micronaut, Micronaut Data and Oracle Cloud to connected to an Oracle Database.
