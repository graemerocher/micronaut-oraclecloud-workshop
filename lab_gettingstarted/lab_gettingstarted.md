# Getting to Know Micronaut

## Introduction
In this lab you will learn how to navigate around a Micronaut project structure.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:
* Learn the layout of a Micronaut project
* Run your first Micronaut application
* Run the tests for your first Micronaut Application

### Prerequisites
- Access to your project instance

## Project Structure
Micronaut projects are structured as per standard Maven-based project conventions.

The following logical structure exists for the application:

* `src/main/java` - This directory contains your Java source code
* `src/main/resources` - The resources directory contains application configuration
* `src/main/resources/application.yml` - A Micronaut application can be configured using YAML, properties files, JSON and many other means. The default is `application.yml` where you can find your application configuration.
* `src/main/resources/logback.xml` - By default Micronaut uses [logback](http://logback.qos.ch) for logging. The `logback.xml` file defines your logging configuration.
* `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` - Depending which build tool you chose you will either have a `build.gradle` for the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org) or `pom.xml` for the [Maven build tool](https://maven.apache.org) which defines your application build file.

## Running the Application
You can run a Micronaut application using the `Application` class which features an executable `main` method. A simple `Application` class looks like the following:

```java
package example.micronaut;

import io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut;

public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Micronaut.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

The `io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut` class bootstraps Micronaut and starts the application (on port 8080 by default) using the embedded Netty-based server.

You can run the application by right-clicking in the cloud IDE and running the main method. Then you can access the application via `http://[YOUR IP]:8080`. Note that you will get a "Page Not Found" error from Micronaut since we haven't defined any controller endpoints yet.

> NOTE: Remember to use the `http` protocol when accessing the instance on port 8080 and not `https` otherwise you will receive an error.

Try this now:

## Automatic Restarts
It is often convenient to have changes you make to your application reflected automatically via a restart of the server.

To do this open Terminal (by clicking ALT+F12 or the Terminal button at the bottom of the window) and type `./gradlew run -t` for Gradle or `./mvnw mn:run` for Maven.

> NOTE: Do not forget to stop the Micronaut application you started in previous step.

Now every time you make a change to one of the sources the server will automatically restart and reflect the change.

## Running Tests
You can run tests in the project simply by right-clicking on the test you wish to run and running the test.

Try this now:

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
